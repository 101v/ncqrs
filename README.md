The Ncqrs Framework
===================

Ncqrs is a framework for .NET helps build scalable, extensible and maintainable
applications by supporting developers apply the Command Query Responsibility
Segregation (CQRS) architectural pattern. It does so by providing an
infrastructure and implementations for the most important building blocks for
command handling, domain modeling, event sourcing, and so. These building blocks
help you to focus on the code that adds business value. They come with
annotation, convention and configuration support and help you to write isolated
and testable.
